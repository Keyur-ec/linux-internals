uname -r // gives kernal version
uname -a // gives ubuntu version

what is os?

os is a set of programs that manipulates and intract with the hardware and provide and environment to run verious application programs

hardware : CPU, memory, I/O peripheral, I/O controller

advantages of linux os :
free, open source, portable any hardware machine, secure, scalable or moduler, epected to run 24/7 without rebooting, takes very short debug time

Lisence:
GPL : GNU Public Linux
GNU : G Not Unix

sources to get linux os
kernal.org
github.com

linux is internally secured [not required 3rd party antivirus software]

we can increse or decrease the size of linux os

error, mistakes, bug, defects, failures, faults


linux booting sequence : 
Steps : 

Power ON -> CPU executes predefine jump instrction from the CPU register [this is hard coded by manufacturer] -> CPU searches for BIOS code,  
		jumping memory location on ROM

BIOS [Basic Input Output System] -> to initialize all the onboard controllers[like VGA contoller, Audio/Video controller, USB controller] 
		-> search for bootloder code from booting device [generally first patition of any device have the bootloader code] 
		-> once bootloader founds BIOS job is done [linux has GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloder)]

Boot Loader -> it looks for OS in Hard disk and loads OS image into RAM -> once its findes OS image it lists to the user -> now bootloder job is done

Kernel startup -> now kernal OS starts exicuting in RAM -> kernal is a first software program that is loded in the RAM and exicutes until we shutdown machine

linux kernal while exicuting creating lots of kernal data structure for file systems, interrupt managment, for process, for memory, for threades, for devices
thread create init procees and it starts login program
