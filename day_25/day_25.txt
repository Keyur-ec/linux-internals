struct sockaddr_in{
	sin_family
	sin_port
	struct in_addr sin_addr
}

bind sys call uses three args
bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr* myaddr, int sockaddress)

bind is used by tcp servers after bind we say that server socket is half binded


listen takes two arg
listen(int sockfd, int len)

listen is used by tcp servers which specify number of client connection request going to server

NOTE :
accept(int socketfd, struct sockaddr* cliaddr, int len)
is a blocking call that will put server in to wait stat until client make a connection request

accept sys call from the server side is accepting client connecting request and fetch info of first client connected and then create a socket of same type and same family and assign fd to it and the socket is called as client socket or connected socket which is used for data transmission



connect(sockfd, struct sockaddr* srvaddr, int len)
typically used by tcp client programs to make connection request to the server
