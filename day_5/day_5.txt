mistake : a mistake in program is called error

defect : before the code is send to cilent the code is tested by testing team cheack weather code is metting the requrements if error is detectded by tester that is called as programming defect
 
bug : if defect is accepted by respective development team then its called bug and fixing and providing solution by using debugging 

failure : inability of software to given task [ex. breakdown in os]

fault : arise due to some condition and leads to os failure [ex. page fault]




compiler are of two types : 
1 -> native compilers
2 -> cross compilers

native compilers -> compiling and generating executable file for local cpu architecture [ex. intel] 



requirement : 
on intel architecture write the program and generate executable file for arm architecture for that cross compiler is needed to be installed on intel architecture


arm cross compilation using make file: 

gnueabi -> g[gnu] n[not] u[unix] e[executable] a[application] b[binary] i[interface]



cross compilation : is a process of generating executable files for other architectures




makefile dependencies
target may have optonal dependencies


sometimes target may depend on other file called as dependent file
dependencies is an inuput file to create target
