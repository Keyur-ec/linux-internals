standard fd [file discripter]

fd table contains all opend files infrmation 
each entry it has base address of a file address and that file object points to inode object

fd value 0, 1, 2 is a standard fd
0 belongs to standard input device
1 belongs to standard output/console device
2 belongs to standard error

when opend first from the program 0, 1, 2 are filled by os and least available fd is given to the user or application

fd are used in basic I/O calls


c library functions internally invokes basic IO calls

without using scanf(), gets(), printf(), puts() we use this functionality by using standard fd

objdump will divide your executable file into section and list onto screen


redirecting the output: 
1. redirector operater (>)
2. dup2() system call


int dup(int fd)  
dup system call is duplicates the file discripter

os will allocate least available fd from the fd table


int dup(int fd, int fd2) // first argument is given by system, second argument is given by user


from the user space accecing inode object info. present in kernal space
1. ls -l
2. stat() & fstat()



structure stat{
	parameter 
	size
	inode number
	/uid
	/gid
}

each and every file waither an opened file or an existing file will maintain structure called as stat structure and that structure maintains ls -l kind of info. for a file 

the moment stat system call execute goes to first argument and goes to file statistic(stat) strucure fatching a structure of info. from and coping into second argument of the system call

stat("file.txt", &stat)
is a addresss pointed by pointer supplyed by the user


fstat() is also doing the same operation as that of stat() system call but condition is file should be opend



stat -fc %s file.txt // block size
ls -i file.txt // inode size
ls -l file.txt // complete info.

linux os provides an fecality for sharing of opened files among multiple apllication [processes] 

where common inode object is shared among multiple applications



permistions : 
it's 3 digit long
permisions are octal digit number

[note : digits from left to right]
first digit : owner 
second digit : user in the same group
third digit : others


permissions is sequence three octal digit number where each octal digit number is taking about permission either by owner or either by user in the same group or by others


to create multiple user method is given below :
by using,

1. user account [GUI]
2. useradd 
	
multiple users to genorate multiple work station


ex.: permission 645

		6	4	5
binary value:  110     100     101
	       rwx     rwx     rwx
	       
	      owner   use in  others
	      	       same 
	      	       group
here : 
r -> read
w -> write
x -> execute


fcntl is a system call used to perform veious control operation on opened file
can be used to change file propertis
fcntl() system call depends on 2nd argument
