uname -r // gives kernal version
uname -a // gives ubuntu version

steps to compile c code : 

preprocessing
compilation
assembler
linker

preprocessing
gcc -E rm_duplicate_from_arr.c -o output.i // -E invokes the preprocess gives .i file
file output.i 

compilation
gcc -S output.i -o output.s // -S invokes the compiler
file output.i

assembler
gcc -C output.s -o output.o // -C invokes the assembler

linker [there are two types dynamic and static linker]

dynamic linker will generates dynemic executable file
static linker will generates static executable file

dynemic linking 
gcc output.c -o output.out

static linking
gcc -static output.c -o output.out

ls -l -h file_name // here -h gives file size in KB's and MB's

static linker is appending entire c library in the object code of the source
dynemic linker is apeending only required c library in the object code of the source

ELF (Executable Loadeble File Format)

linux OS understands ELF 64 bit file format compiler will process and the processed code paked in ELF 64 bit file format



vim is most popular editor used in linux and unix OS
vim is command oriented editor

it works in two mode : 
insersion mode
command mode

in insersion mode whatever you write its displyed on the screen

if we press some related keys vim operating in command mode

:wq (w for saving and q for quiting)
:q! (quit without saving)

if you open vim without file name then after putting data press esc 
press :wq file_name


// below command operates only in command mode

l -> moved cursor towards to right side
h -> moved cursor towards to left side
j -> moved cursor towards to down
k -> moved cursor towards to up side

o -> new line below cursor and also put into insert mode
O -> new line above cursor and also put into insert mode

a -> insersion happen after the cursor position
A -> insersion happen at the end of the line

yy -> copy perticular line
p -> paste data
x -> delete data
u -> undo data


source code browsing tool:

cscope tool is to examine symbols [variable name, function, macros]
once cscope command enterd from terminal will take yout to interactive screen and gives you multiple option to examine your source code


use tab key to again goto multiple option 

in change this text string option prees ctrl+d to save
ctag



redirecter operator
./output > test.txt
